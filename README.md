# findanddelete
A Python File and Folder Cleaner

- This program is designed to remove files older than 1week, 1month, and 3months
- It will also delete empty directories older one week
- To prevent recursive deletion of the source directory tree, set a README file at the top directory to be immutable
- Deletions will be logged to a specified file
- This was build against python 2.7.5 but should work with 3.6
